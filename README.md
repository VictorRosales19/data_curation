# data_curation
This project is to create a curated dataset and a reproducible workflow that integrates data from bike-sharing trips in Washington, D.C. (Capital Bikeshare) and Los Angeles (Metro Bikeshare), and to add contextual weather data (Open-Meteo) and demographic data (U.S. Census ACS), utilizing the USGS Science Data Life Cycle framework.
